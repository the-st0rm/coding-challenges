# coding challenges
This is some coding challenges that I have been practicing for a while.
Most of the challenges contain the challenge url in the first line of the .py file. Some of the challenges are written in C/C++ (I used to code that for 5 years) and the I coded them in Python as part of learning python. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of my C/C++ solutions because I can't find them.
